# Advent of Code 2022 TS Solutions ❄️☃️
Oh hey, it's December already. Time really flies huh...  
Anyway here are my TypeScript solutions for each day of AOC 2022.

## How to use
Import the `getAnswer` function and pass the input (as a string) to it to get the solution for each puzzle.  
AOC gives you 2 puzzles for each day, so there will be 2 solutions.  
*There's an example for each input as well, in case you want to test or just want to take a peek.*
```ts
import { getAnswer } from './day-x/solution-y.ts'

console.log(getAnswer('input here'))
```
