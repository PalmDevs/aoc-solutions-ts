# Advent of Code 2022 TS Solutions ❄️☃️
Oh hey, it's December already. Time really flies huh...  
Anyway here are my TypeScript solutions for each day of AOC 2022.

## How to use
Import the `getAnswer` function and pass the input (as a string) to it to get the solutions.  
*There's an example for each input as well, if you want to test or take a peek.*
```ts
import { getAnswer } from './day-x.ts'

getAnswer('input here')
```
